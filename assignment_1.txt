Rajan, who had as the chief economist at IMF warned of impending financial crisis of 2008, in a note to a parliamentary committee warned against ambitious credit targets and loan waivers, saying 	that they could be the sources of next banking crisis. Government should focus on sources of the next crisis, not just the last one. In particular, government should refrain from setting ambitious credit targets or waiving loans. Credit targets are sometimes achieved by abandoning appropriate due diligence, creating the environment for future NPAs," Rajan said in the note." Both MUDRA loans as well as the Kisan Credit Card, while popular, have to 	be examined more closely for potential credit risk. Rajan, who was RBI governor for three years till September 2016, is currently");
